description: Use the opz CLI to search 1Password items, inspect valid env labels, manage 1Password Developer Environments through MCP, import Cloudflare credentials and redacted API responses, run integrity-pinned declarative plugins, diagnose dependencies, generate env files, migrate repository metadata, export deploy secrets, and run commands with item-backed or Environment-backed secret injection.

# opz

Use this skill when you need to work with 1Password-backed secrets through the `opz` CLI. `opz` reads item metadata from `op`, builds `op://<vault_id>/<item_id>/<field>` references for valid env labels, and can resolve those references while running another command. When using 1Password Environments, `opz run --environment <ENV> -- <COMMAND>` delegates to native `op run` so `opz` does not read Environment secret values. `opz environment` uses the 1Password MCP server for Environment management, variable-name inspection, and local `.env` mounts without printing secret values. `opz plugin` consumes digest-verified declarative releases from the bundled `opz-plugin` registry; item metadata pins source, version, and SHA-256 before any secret is resolved.

## Prerequisites

- 1Password CLI (`op`) is installed and authenticated.
- The official 1Password MCP server executable `1password-mcp` is available. Enable Settings > Labs > MCP Server and Settings > Developer > Integrate with MCP clients in the 1Password app. `OPZ_1PASSWORD_MCP_COMMAND` may point to an explicit executable; the older `onepassword-mcp` name is accepted as a fallback.
- The relevant vault and item names are known, can be discovered with `opz find`, or can be auto-detected from item titles that match the current git remote repository name.

## Global Options

- `--vault <NAME>` limits item lookup to a specific 1Password vault.
- `--env-file <ENV>` writes generated `op://` references to a file for `run` and `gen`; prefer file-free `run` unless another tool requires an env file.
- `--environment <ENV>` / `--environments <ENV>` uses native 1Password Environments injection through `op run`; do not combine it with item arguments or `--env-file`.

## Commands

### `find`

Search item titles by keyword. Output rows are item id, vault name, and title.

```bash
opz find <query>
```

### `show`

List valid environment variable labels from one or more 1Password items.

```bash
opz show [OPTIONS] <ITEM>...
opz show --with-item <ITEM>...
```

### `doctor`

Check `op` authentication, the 1Password Desktop SDK read path, the 1Password MCP server command, external command dependencies, and plaintext `.env`-style credential files. Required `op` failures exit non-zero; Desktop SDK failures, missing optional tools, missing MCP server, and credential-file findings are warnings. When the Desktop SDK is unavailable, enable **Settings → Developer → Integrate with the 1Password SDKs → Integrate with other apps**.

```bash
opz doctor
```

### `environment` / `env`

Manage 1Password Developer Environments through the 1Password MCP server. If `--account <ACCOUNT_ID>` is omitted, `opz` asks the 1Password app to authenticate through MCP. `add` creates empty concealed placeholders so secret values do not enter argv or `opz` output; set their values in the 1Password app. `tools` performs MCP `tools/list` without account authentication. These commands only print Environment IDs, names, variable names, tool names, and local mount paths.

```bash
opz environment [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] list
opz environment [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] create <NAME>
opz environment [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] rename <ENVIRONMENT> <NEW_NAME>
opz environment [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] variables <ENVIRONMENT>
opz environment [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] add <ENVIRONMENT> <NAME>...
opz environment [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] mount <ENVIRONMENT> <PATH>
opz environment [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] mounts <ENVIRONMENT>
opz environment tools
opz env list
```

### `plugin`

List, inspect, and run declarative launch plugins. A run requires exactly one item with `OPZ_PLUGIN_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `OPZ_PLUGIN`, `OPZ_PLUGIN_SOURCE`, `OPZ_PLUGIN_VERSION`, and `OPZ_PLUGIN_SHA256`. `OPZ_PLUGIN_CONFIG` is an optional flat scalar TOML table. Plugin metadata is not forwarded as environment variables. Revoked releases are blocked; deprecated releases need `--allow-deprecated`.

```bash
opz plugin list
opz plugin show <NAME[@VERSION]>
opz plugin run <NAME[@VERSION]> [--item <ITEM>] [--allow-deprecated] -- <COMMAND>...
```

Normal `opz run` auto-applies a pinned plugin when exactly one selected item declares `OPZ_PLUGIN`. The runtime validates digest, lifecycle, target, config, exact secret allowlist, temporary-file mode, and workspace containment before launch. `OPZ_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_DIR` may select an explicit local registry checkout, but manifests remain data-only and digest-verified.

### `gen`

Generate `op://...` environment variable references without running a command. Stdout is sectioned by item; file output is a merged key list.

```bash
opz gen [OPTIONS] <ITEM>...
opz gen --env-file .env.local <ITEM>...
```

### `migrate`

Migrate `justfile`/`Justfile` recipes and `package.json` scripts from explicit item names or `.env` usage to repository item titles and metadata. `--new` creates an `API_CREDENTIAL` item from `.env` first. `--restore` restores explicit item arguments for scripts that were previously migrated to itemless auto-detection.

```bash
opz migrate [OPTIONS]
opz migrate --dry-run
opz migrate --new
opz migrate --restore
```

### `note`

Store a private config file as Secure Note item(s) titled from parseable git remotes such as `org/repo`.

```bash
opz note <FILE>
```

### `run`

Run a command with secrets from one or more items injected as environment variables. Arguments are passed unchanged; `opz` never substitutes resolved values into `$VAR` or `${VAR}` in argv.
When no item is passed, `run` tries a title matching a git remote repository name such as `owner/repo`, then a standard website matching `origin`.

```bash
opz run [OPTIONS] [<ITEM>...] -- <COMMAND>...
opz [OPTIONS] [<ITEM>...] -- <COMMAND>...
opz run --environment <ENV> -- <COMMAND>...
opz --environment <ENV> -- <COMMAND>...
```

Prefer commands that read their environment directly. If stdin delivery is
required, make the shell an explicit trusted child:

```bash
opz run my-service -- sh -c 'printf "%s" "$API_TOKEN" | trusted-consumer --token-stdin'
```

When title auto-detection (including the opt-in legacy scan) finds no match, `run` matches `origin` against standard item websites. Website `https://github.com/acme/my-app` matches SSH or HTTPS origins for that repository, so `opz run -- npm run dev` works with an arbitrary item title. Matching retains host and full path; application URLs are not inferred, and multiple matches fail before secret resolution. The first lookup reads items in the selected vault or all vaults and caches only item IDs and normalized repository identities for 60 seconds. Raw URLs, fields, and values are never cached. URLs with ports, queries, fragments, or percent encoding are excluded.

### `github-secret`

Store valid item fields as GitHub repository secrets. If an item has `github_repositories` metadata, the target repository must match before secrets are resolved or written.

```bash
opz github-secret [OPTIONS] <ITEM>...
opz github-secret --repo owner/repo <ITEM>...
opz github-secret --dry-run <ITEM>...
```

### `github-repo`

Add or update `github_repositories` metadata on existing 1Password items. `--repo` can be repeated; if omitted, parseable git remotes from the current repository are used.

```bash
opz github-repo [OPTIONS] <ITEM>...
opz github-repo --repo owner/repo --repo other/service <ITEM>...
opz github-repo --dry-run <ITEM>...
```

### `cloudflare-credential`

Import a Cloudflare API token, Worker secrets, or a JSON API response into an exact-title 1Password item. Choose exactly one source: `--stdin`, `--file <JSON>`, or a command after `--`. Values are sent to `op item create` or `op item edit` through a JSON template on stdin, and successful writes print only `op://` references.

```bash
opz cloudflare-credential --preset api-token --item cloudflare-prod --stdin
opz cloudflare-credential --preset worker-secret --item worker-prod --file secrets.json
opz cloudflare-credential --preset api-response --item cloudflare-audit -- cloudflare-client zones list --json
opz cloudflare-credential --preset api-response --item cloudflare-audit --dry-run --file response.json
```

Use `--mode create`, `--mode update`, or the default `--mode upsert`. `--section` and `--field` override preset destinations. API responses recursively redact Authorization, Cookie, and token/secret/key-like fields. `--raw` is valid only for `api-response` and must be explicit.

### `cloudflare-secret`

Store valid item fields as Cloudflare Worker secrets through Wrangler.

```bash
opz cloudflare-secret [OPTIONS] <ITEM>...
opz cloudflare-secret --name worker-app --env production <ITEM>...
opz cloudflare-secret --dry-run <ITEM>...
```

### `skills`

Print this bundled Agent Skills `SKILL.md` to stdout.

```bash
opz skills
```

### removed `create`

`opz create` is hidden and only returns a migration error. Use `opz migrate --new` for `.env` imports and `opz note <FILE>` for non-`.env` private files.

## Behavior Notes

- When multiple items define the same env key, later items win.
- `doctor` checks `op` as required and probes the 1Password Desktop SDK read path. SDK failures are optional warnings with the **Settings → Developer → Integrate with the 1Password SDKs → Integrate with other apps** enable path. It also reports the 1Password MCP server command, `gh`, `wrangler`, `git`, `sh`, `secretlint`, and plaintext `.env`-style files as optional warnings.
- `github-secret` also uses later-item-wins and passes values to `gh secret set` through stdin.
- `github-secret` rejects names starting with `GITHUB_` and blocks writes when item `github_repositories` metadata does not include the target repo.
- `github-repo` migrates existing items by merging repository metadata into `github_repositories`.
- `migrate` keeps explicit `opz run <ITEM> --` usage by default, updates item metadata, and when exactly one item and one repository are present, renames the item title and matching Just item variable to `owner/repo`; use `--dry-run` to preview. Dry runs do not fetch full item details; they report the repository metadata that would be ensured.
- `migrate --restore` rewrites itemless `opz run --` usage back to explicit item arguments where it can infer the item from a Just recipe parameter or current repository title.
- `migrate` treats `op item get <ITEM>` as a metadata signal but does not rewrite it.
- `migrate` patches matching `package.json` script strings without reserializing the whole file.
- `run` auto-detects an item when no item is passed and exactly one item title matches the current git remote repository. If no title matches, standard websites are matched against `origin`. Legacy `github_repositories` scanning is opt-in with `OPZ_AUTODETECT_LEGACY_SCAN=1`.
- Environment-backed `run` is delegated to `op run` and does not resolve secret values in `opz`. Use `opz environment` for MCP-backed Environment creation, renaming, variable-name inspection, concealed placeholder addition, server tool inspection, and local `.env` mounting.
- `opz environment variables` lists variable names only. It does not read or print Environment variable values.
- `opz environment add` sends only variable names, empty values, and `concealed=true` to `append_variables`; set real values in the 1Password app.
- `opz environment tools` lists the tool names advertised by the connected server and does not authenticate to a 1Password account.
- `opz environment mount` creates a synced local `.env` mount through the MCP server. `opz` does not write secret values itself.
- `github_repositories` and all `OPZ_PLUGIN*` fields are metadata, not env labels or deployable secrets.
- Plugin runs project only `secret_env_allowlist` fields and use a private temporary workspace; revoked plugins never run.
- `cloudflare-credential` imports at most 16 MiB, stores concealed fields, suppresses failed source-command stderr, and sends complete item templates to `op` through stdin.
- `cloudflare-credential` redacts API responses by default; raw response storage requires explicit `--raw`.
- `cloudflare-secret` also uses later-item-wins and passes a JSON payload to `wrangler secret bulk` through stdin.
- `cloudflare-secret` supports `--name`, `--env`, and `--config` for Wrangler target selection.
- `gen` stdout uses `op://<vault_id>/<item_id>/<field>` references, not resolved secret values.
- Persistent env files contain `op://` references, preserve unrelated lines and existing permissions, reject symlinks/non-regular targets, and use mode `0600` for new files on Unix.
- Resolved values are passed only through a trusted child environment, `gh` stdin, or `wrangler` stdin; they are never added to argv.
- `show` only prints labels that are valid shell environment variable names.
- Explicit item titles are resolved with direct `op item get <title>` first; item list caching is used for fuzzy title fallback and legacy migration paths.
- Item lists and the legacy auto-detect repository index are cached for 60 seconds. Creating or editing items invalidates those caches best-effort.
- Secret-resolution `op` calls time out after 30 seconds by default. Set `OPZ_OP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=<seconds>` to allow slower 1Password CLI operations. MCP responses also time out after 30 seconds; set `OPZ_MCP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=<seconds>` when approval flows need longer. Batch secret-resolution timeouts stop immediately instead of retrying once per secret.
## Suggested Workflow

1. Discover candidate items with `opz find`.
2. Run `opz doctor` if `op` authentication or a dependency CLI looks suspicious.
3. Inspect available labels with `opz show`.
4. Use `opz run ... -- <COMMAND>` for the normal file-free workflow.
5. Use `opz run --environment <ENV> -- <COMMAND>` when the project is managed through 1Password Environments and the local `op` CLI supports native Environment injection.
6. Use `opz environment list`, `opz environment variables <ENV>`, `opz environment add <ENV> <NAME>...`, `opz environment tools`, and `opz environment mount <ENV> .env.local` when managing 1Password Developer Environments through MCP.
7. Use `opz plugin list` and `opz plugin show <NAME[@VERSION]>` before pinning a release; use `opz plugin run ...` for an explicit plugin launch.
8. Use `opz gen --env-file ...` only when another tool needs `op://` references in a file.
9. Use `opz migrate --dry-run` to preview script migration, then `opz migrate`, `opz migrate --new`, or `opz migrate --restore`.
10. Use `opz github-repo --dry-run ...` to manually add repository metadata for older items.
11. Use `opz github-secret --dry-run ...` before writing GitHub repository secrets.
12. Use `opz cloudflare-credential --dry-run ...` before importing Cloudflare credentials or API responses.
13. Use `opz cloudflare-secret --dry-run ...` before writing Cloudflare Worker secrets.
